# Syllabus
## Overview
### Description
Machine Learning for Audio Classification is an independent study in machine learning techniques with an emphasis on how to use these techniques for audio classification and other audio-related problems. The primary focus of the course will be learning and using general purpose machine learning techniques, but along the way audio coding and models of human hearing will also be visited.
### Objetives
* Learn about the fundamentals of neural networks and different neural network schemes
* Learn tools to build neural networks such as TensorFlow
* Use machine learning techniques to solve data-driven problems and evaluate their performance.
* Learn about models for hearing and about digital audio processing
* Use learnings to create an interactive audio classification tool
* Practice professional code and documentation writing
### Learning Goals
* Learn about the tools and strategies used to solve problems with machine learning
* Gain a deeper understanding of audio coding and how humans and computers process sound
* Create a well-documented tool that can be shared with the wider community
### Prerequisites
Software Design: Most of the code in this course will be written in Python, and will require concepts learned in Software Design.
Signals and Systems/Quantitative Engineering Analysis II: Understanding audio processing requires an understanding of working with signals in the time and frequency domain and filtering signals.
