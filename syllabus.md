Course Participant: Ariana Olson

Advisor: Paul Ruvolo
## Overview
### Description
Machine Learning for Audio Classification is an independent study in machine learning techniques with an emphasis on how to use these techniques for audio classification and other audio-related problems. The primary focus of the course will be learning and using general purpose machine learning techniques, but along the way audio coding and models of human hearing will also be visited.
### Objetives
* Learn about the fundamentals of neural networks and different neural network schemes
* Learn tools to build neural networks such as TensorFlow
* Use machine learning techniques to solve data-driven problems and evaluate their performance.
* Learn about models for hearing and about digital audio processing
* Use learnings to create an interactive audio classification tool
* Practice professional code and documentation writing
### Learning Goals
* Learn about the tools and strategies used to solve problems with machine learning
* Gain a deeper understanding of audio coding and how humans and computers process sound
* Create a well-documented tool that can be shared with the wider community
### Prerequisites
Software Design: Most of the code in this course will be written in Python, and will require concepts learned in Software Design.
Signals and Systems/Quantitative Engineering Analysis II: Understanding audio processing requires an understanding of working with signals in the time and frequency domain and filtering signals.### Resources

*More resources may be added as the course progresses*

### Assesment Methods
All assignments will be pushed to this repository, where they will be assessed. Assignments will be accompanied by a short reflection on what went right, wrong, and what adjustments should be made for future assignments. Additionally, the reflection will include a brief overview of the learning done for the assignment. Assignments will be assessed on the following metrics:
* Professionalism: Submitted assignments will be well documented and adherent to the PEP 8 style guide. Assignments will be completed on time.
* Performance: The assignments will be accompanied by documentation of performance metrics, relevant figures, and possible improvements going forward. The final submissions of assignments should run without error.
* Reflection: A meaningful reflection will accompany assignments. The reflection will include what went well and what should be changed going forward and an assessment of progress towards learning goals.
Demonstration of Learning: Assignment write ups should include a section about the learning that happened through readings and exercises. 

### Adjustment and Course Corrections
Based on weekly reflections and advisor meetings, adjustments to the weekly readings and activities should be made if necessary. The final project is intentionally defined in such a way as to be flexible to changing learning goals. The course syllabus on the Github class repository will be updated to reflect all changes to the course.
