# Week 2 Reflection
## Learning
I dove into a couple of areas this week. First, I began to review the basics of neural networks using *Neural Networks and Deep Learning*. I was familiar with the concepts of perceptrons and gradient descent, but reviewing these concepts felt like a good way to ease into things. I also began the Neural Network of another resource, *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning* by Christopher M. Bishop. The other area of study this week was learning TensorFLow. I completed the [Convolutional Neural Network](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/layers) tutorial. I not only started to gain some familiarity with using the library, but I also learned about image convolution and pooling.
## Reflection
### What Went Well
I was very excited to get started this week. I think that I am beginning to have a good understanding of some basics. Completing the TensorFlow tutorial along with reading the textbooks was interesting. I found the *NNDL* book the easiest to understand, as it is self-contained and aimed at beginners. The *PRML* book will be a good resource for a more in-depth mathematical look at neural networks, but I don't think I will be using it on its own. WHile looking at these introductory resources, I also was building a CNN, which introduced new concepts and techniques that are more advanced. I think that the tutorials may initially be more useful for learning advanced concepts and common neural network structures than for actually learning the library itself.

In terms of scheduling, I am happ with my decision to create weekly calendar events for myself to work on class, as I would have in a regular class. Having a solid block of time that I do not allow myself to schedule meetings over means that I prioritize this class at the same level as my other classes.
### What Could Be Improved
I am finding that the amount of work I have assigned myself each week to be too much. In 8 hours, I was able to get a tutorial done and go over about a chapter's worth of book reading. Additionally, I think that I am taking too much time to thoroughly read the materials when I should be spending more time on exercises and writing code.

My time management also felt off this week because of the Olin Monday cutting into my Wednesday scheduled class time. On top of this, I had a heavy workload form my other 4 classes. I am concerned about my overall workload as the semester progresses and classes become more demanding. 
## Goals For Week 3

1. Focus on exercises and implementation over a fine grain understanding of readings. Take more time for exercises and tutorials, and practice implementing networks from the readings using TensorFlow.
2. Schedule additional homework time over the weekend for class.
3. Catch up on necessary work from this week and reassess scheduled work for the next couple of weeks to be more manageable in the future.
